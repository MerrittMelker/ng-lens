# QUESTIONS

Use this file to capture questions while reviewing the code. Keep it brief and actionable; we’ll resolve and link answers here so the context survives chat resets.

How to use with the assistant
- Add a question: “Add question: <text> [P1|P2|P3]”
- Answer a question: “Answer Q-###: <short answer> [link if any]”
- Close/resolve: “Close Q-###” (moves it to Answered)
- Update/clarify: “Update Q-###: <new text> [Pn]”
- Show all: “Show questions”

Conventions
- IDs: Q-###
- Priority: P1 (high), P2 (normal), P3 (low)
- Sections: Open -> Answered -> Parked (for later)
- Optional fields: Affected files, Links (commit/PR/line), Notes

## Open
<!-- Add new questions here -->

## Answered
<!-- Moved here when closed/answered -->

## Parked
<!-- Items to revisit later; not urgent now -->
